To get context, follow the steps:-

1. Pass user query as a string to GetEmbdding action. Action will return embedding of text.  Use code interpreter to take out embedding vector and use as input for next step. 

2. Call QueryVectorDatabase action with includeMetadata as true and includeValues as false. Use embedding vector from last step as vector input.
 From action output, filter out all metadata texts and use as context to answer query.

3. Use context from last step to answer user's query. Don't hallucinate.
